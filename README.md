# Getting Started

1. **Download:** Head over to the [releases](https://github.com/thirdweb-dev/unity-sdk/releases) page and download the latest `.unitypackage` file.
2. **Explore:** Try out `Scene_Playground` to explore functionality and get onboarded.
3. **Learn:** Explore the [Unity v5 SDK Docs](https://portal.thirdweb.com/unity/v5) and the [.NET SDK Docs](https://portal.thirdweb.com/dotnet) to find a full API reference.

**Notes:**

- Tested on Unity 2021.3+, 2022.3+, Unity 6 Preview. We recommend using 2022 LTS.
- Newtonsoft DLL included; deselect if already installed to avoid conflicts.
- If using .NET Framework and encountering `HttpUtility` errors, create `csc.rsp` with `-r:System.Web.dll` under `Assets`.
- Use version control and test removing duplicate DLLs if conflicts arise.

# Build Instructions

## General

- **Build Settings:** Use `Smaller (faster) Builds` / `Shorter Build Time`.
- **Player Settings:** Use IL2CPP over Mono when available.
- **Stripping Level:** Set `Managed Stripping Level` to `Minimal` (`Player Settings` > `Other Settings` > `Optimization`). (Alternatively, if you do not want to use Minimal Stripping, you may use a linker.xml instead to preserve assemblies that are being stripped and causing errors at runtime)

## WebGL

- **WebGL Template:** None enforced, feel free to customize!
- **Compression Format:** Set to `Disabled` (`Player Settings` > `Publishing Settings`) for final builds.
- **Testing WebGL Social Login Locally:** Host the build or run it locally with `Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy` set to `same-origin-allow-popups`.

Example setup for testing In-App Wallet (Social Login) locally:

```javascript
// YourWebGLOutputFolder/server.js
const express = require("express");
const app = express();
const port = 8000;

app.use((req, res, next) => {
  res.header("Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy", "same-origin-allow-popups");
  next();
});

app.use(express.static("."));
app.listen(port, () =>
  console.log(`Server running on http://localhost:${port}`)
);

// run it with `node server.js`
```

No action needed for hosted builds.

## Mobile

- **EDM4U:** Comes with the package, resolves dependencies at runtime. Use `Force Resolve` from `Assets` > `External Dependency Manager` > `Android Resolver`.
- **Redirect Schemes:** Set custom schemes matching your bundle ID in `Plugins/AndroidManifest.xml` or equivalent to ensure OAuth redirects.
