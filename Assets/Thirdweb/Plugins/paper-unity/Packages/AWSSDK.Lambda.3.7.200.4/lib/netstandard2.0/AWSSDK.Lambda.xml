            Container for the parameters to the CreateFunction operation.
            Creates a Lambda function. To create a function, you need a <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/gettingstarted-package.html">deployment
            package</a> and an <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/intro-permission-model.html#lambda-intro-execution-role">execution
            role</a>. The deployment package is a .zip file archive or container image that contains
            your function code. The execution role grants the function permission to use Amazon
            Web Services, such as Amazon CloudWatch Logs for log streaming and X-Ray for request
            tracing.
            
             
            <para>
            If the deployment package is a <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-images.html">container
            image</a>, then you set the package type to <code>Image</code>. For a container image,
            the code property must include the URI of a container image in the Amazon ECR registry.
            You do not need to specify the handler and runtime properties.
            </para>
             
            <para>
            If the deployment package is a <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/gettingstarted-package.html#gettingstarted-package-zip">.zip
            file archive</a>, then you set the package type to <code>Zip</code>. For a .zip file
            archive, the code property specifies the location of the .zip file. You must also
            specify the handler and runtime properties. The code in the deployment package must
            be compatible with the target instruction set architecture of the function (<code>x86-64</code>
            or <code>arm64</code>). If you do not specify the architecture, then the default value
            is <code>x86-64</code>.
            </para>
             
            <para>
            When you create a function, Lambda provisions an instance of the function and its
            supporting resources. If your function connects to a VPC, this process can take a
            minute or so. During this time, you can't invoke or modify the function. The <code>State</code>,
            <code>StateReason</code>, and <code>StateReasonCode</code> fields in the response
            from <a>GetFunctionConfiguration</a> indicate when the function is ready to invoke.
            For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/functions-states.html">Lambda
            function states</a>.
            </para>
             
            <para>
            A function has an unpublished version, and can have published versions and aliases.
            The unpublished version changes when you update your function's code and configuration.
            A published version is a snapshot of your function code and configuration that can't
            be changed. An alias is a named resource that maps to a version, and can be changed
            to map to a different version. Use the <code>Publish</code> parameter to create version
            <code>1</code> of your function from its initial configuration.
            </para>
             
            <para>
            The other parameters let you configure version-specific and function-level settings.
            You can modify version-specific settings later with <a>UpdateFunctionConfiguration</a>.
            Function-level settings apply to both the unpublished and published versions of the
            function, and include tags (<a>TagResource</a>) and per-function concurrency limits
            (<a>PutFunctionConcurrency</a>).
            </para>
             
            <para>
            You can use code signing if your deployment package is a .zip file archive. To enable
            code signing for this function, specify the ARN of a code-signing configuration. When
            a user attempts to deploy a code package with <a>UpdateFunctionCode</a>, Lambda checks
            that the code package has a valid signature from a trusted publisher. The code-signing
            configuration includes set of signing profiles, which define the trusted publishers
            for this function.

            <para>
            If another Amazon Web Services account or an Amazon Web Service invokes your function,
            use <a>AddPermission</a> to grant permission by creating a resource-based Identity
            and Access Management (IAM) policy. You can grant permissions at the function level,
            on a version, or on an alias.
            </para>
             
            <para>
            To invoke your function directly, use <a>Invoke</a>. To invoke your function in response
            to events in other Amazon Web Services, create an event source mapping (<a>CreateEventSourceMapping</a>),
            or configure a function trigger in the other service. For more information, see <a

            For <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/invocation-async.html">asynchronous
            invocation</a>, Lambda adds events to a queue before sending them to your function.
            If your function does not have enough capacity to keep up with the queue, events may
            be lost. Occasionally, your function may receive the same event multiple times, even
            if no error occurs. To retain events that were not processed, configure your function
            with a <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/invocation-async.html#invocation-dlq">dead-letter
            queue</a>.

            The status code in the API response doesn't reflect function errors. Error codes are
            reserved for errors that prevent your function from executing, such as permissions
            errors, <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/gettingstarted-limits.html">quota</a>
            errors, or issues with your function's code and configuration. For example, Lambda
            returns <code>TooManyRequestsException</code> if running the function would cause
            you to exceed a concurrency limit at either the account level (<code>ConcurrentInvocationLimitExceeded</code>)
            or function level (<code>ReservedFunctionConcurrentInvocationLimitExceeded</code>).

            For functions with a long timeout, your client might disconnect during synchronous
            invocation while it waits for a response. Configure your HTTP client, SDK, firewall,
            proxy, or operating system to allow for long connections with timeout or keep-alive
            settings.

            <para>
            When you update a function, Lambda provisions an instance of the function and its
            supporting resources. If your function connects to a VPC, this process can take a
            minute. During this time, you can't modify the function, but you can still invoke
            it. The <code>LastUpdateStatus</code>, <code>LastUpdateStatusReason</code>, and <code>LastUpdateStatusReasonCode</code>
            fields in the response from <a>GetFunctionConfiguration</a> indicate when the update
            is complete and the function is processing events with the new configuration. For
            more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/functions-states.html">Lambda

            version.

The auto detection might query <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-instance-metadata.html">EC2 Instance Metadata service</a>, which might introduce latency.

             Lambda is a compute service that lets you run code without provisioning or managing
             servers. Lambda runs your code on a high-availability compute infrastructure and performs
             all of the administration of the compute resources, including server and operating
             system maintenance, capacity provisioning and automatic scaling, code monitoring and
             logging. With Lambda, you can run code for virtually any type of application or backend
             service. For more information about the Lambda service, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/welcome.html">What
             is Lambda</a> in the <b>Lambda Developer Guide</b>.

             <para>
             Because Amazon Web Services SDKs use the CA certificates from your computer, changes
             to the certificates on the Amazon Web Services servers can cause connection failures
             when you attempt to use an SDK. You can prevent these failures by keeping your computer's
             CA certificates and operating system up-to-date. If you encounter this issue in a
             corporate environment and do not manage your own computer, you might need to ask an
             administrator to assist with the update process. The following list shows minimum

            Creates a Lambda function. To create a function, you need a <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/gettingstarted-package.html">deployment
            package</a> and an <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/intro-permission-model.html#lambda-intro-execution-role">execution
            role</a>. The deployment package is a .zip file archive or container image that contains
            your function code. The execution role grants the function permission to use Amazon
            Web Services, such as Amazon CloudWatch Logs for log streaming and X-Ray for request
            tracing.

            If the deployment package is a <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-images.html">container
            image</a>, then you set the package type to <code>Image</code>. For a container image,
            the code property must include the URI of a container image in the Amazon ECR registry.
            You do not need to specify the handler and runtime properties.

            file archive</a>, then you set the package type to <code>Zip</code>. For a .zip file
            archive, the code property specifies the location of the .zip file. You must also
            specify the handler and runtime properties. The code in the deployment package must
            be compatible with the target instruction set architecture of the function (<code>x86-64</code>
            or <code>arm64</code>). If you do not specify the architecture, then the default value
            is <code>x86-64</code>.

            <para>
            When you create a function, Lambda provisions an instance of the function and its
            supporting resources. If your function connects to a VPC, this process can take a
            minute or so. During this time, you can't invoke or modify the function. The <code>State</code>,
            <code>StateReason</code>, and <code>StateReasonCode</code> fields in the response
            from <a>GetFunctionConfiguration</a> indicate when the function is ready to invoke.
            For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/functions-states.html">Lambda

            <para>
            A function has an unpublished version, and can have published versions and aliases.
            The unpublished version changes when you update your function's code and configuration.
            A published version is a snapshot of your function code and configuration that can't
            be changed. An alias is a named resource that maps to a version, and can be changed
            to map to a different version. Use the <code>Publish</code> parameter to create version
            <code>1</code> of your function from its initial configuration.
            </para>
             
            <para>
            The other parameters let you configure version-specific and function-level settings.
            You can modify version-specific settings later with <a>UpdateFunctionConfiguration</a>.
            Function-level settings apply to both the unpublished and published versions of the
            function, and include tags (<a>TagResource</a>) and per-function concurrency limits
            (<a>PutFunctionConcurrency</a>).

            <para>
            You can use code signing if your deployment package is a .zip file archive. To enable
            code signing for this function, specify the ARN of a code-signing configuration. When
            a user attempts to deploy a code package with <a>UpdateFunctionCode</a>, Lambda checks
            that the code package has a valid signature from a trusted publisher. The code-signing
            configuration includes set of signing profiles, which define the trusted publishers
            for this function.

            If another Amazon Web Services account or an Amazon Web Service invokes your function,
            use <a>AddPermission</a> to grant permission by creating a resource-based Identity
            and Access Management (IAM) policy. You can grant permissions at the function level,
            on a version, or on an alias.

            <para>
            To invoke your function directly, use <a>Invoke</a>. To invoke your function in response
            to events in other Amazon Web Services, create an event source mapping (<a>CreateEventSourceMapping</a>),
            or configure a function trigger in the other service. For more information, see <a

            Invokes a Lambda function. You can invoke a function synchronously (and wait for the

            For <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/invocation-sync.html">synchronous
            invocation</a>, details about the function response, including errors, are included
            in the response body and headers. For either invocation type, you can find more information
            in the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/monitoring-functions.html">execution

            When an error occurs, your function may be invoked multiple times. Retry behavior
            varies by error type, client, event source, and invocation type. For example, if you
            invoke a function asynchronously and it returns an error, Lambda executes the function
            up to two more times. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/invocation-retries.html">Error
            handling and automatic retries in Lambda</a>.

            For <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/invocation-async.html">asynchronous
            invocation</a>, Lambda adds events to a queue before sending them to your function.
            If your function does not have enough capacity to keep up with the queue, events may
            be lost. Occasionally, your function may receive the same event multiple times, even
            if no error occurs. To retain events that were not processed, configure your function
            with a <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/invocation-async.html#invocation-dlq">dead-letter
            queue</a>.

            The status code in the API response doesn't reflect function errors. Error codes are

            errors, or issues with your function's code and configuration. For example, Lambda
            returns <code>TooManyRequestsException</code> if running the function would cause
            you to exceed a concurrency limit at either the account level (<code>ConcurrentInvocationLimitExceeded</code>)
            or function level (<code>ReservedFunctionConcurrentInvocationLimitExceeded</code>).

            For functions with a long timeout, your client might disconnect during synchronous

            When you update a function, Lambda provisions an instance of the function and its
            supporting resources. If your function connects to a VPC, this process can take a
            minute. During this time, you can't modify the function, but you can still invoke
            it. The <code>LastUpdateStatus</code>, <code>LastUpdateStatusReason</code>, and <code>LastUpdateStatusReasonCode</code>
            fields in the response from <a>GetFunctionConfiguration</a> indicate when the update
            is complete and the function is processing events with the new configuration. For

             Lambda is a compute service that lets you run code without provisioning or managing
             servers. Lambda runs your code on a high-availability compute infrastructure and performs
             all of the administration of the compute resources, including server and operating
             system maintenance, capacity provisioning and automatic scaling, code monitoring and
             logging. With Lambda, you can run code for virtually any type of application or backend
             service. For more information about the Lambda service, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/welcome.html">What

             When making the API calls, you will need to authenticate your request by providing

             Because Amazon Web Services SDKs use the CA certificates from your computer, changes
             to the certificates on the Amazon Web Services servers can cause connection failures
             when you attempt to use an SDK. You can prevent these failures by keeping your computer's
             CA certificates and operating system up-to-date. If you encounter this issue in a
             corporate environment and do not manage your own computer, you might need to ask an

            To grant permission to another account, specify the account ID as the <code>Principal</code>.
            To grant permission to an organization defined in Organizations, specify the organization
            ID as the <code>PrincipalOrgID</code>. For Amazon Web Services, the principal is a
            domain-style identifier that the service defines, such as <code>s3.amazonaws.com</code>
            or <code>sns.amazonaws.com</code>. For Amazon Web Services, you can also specify the
            ARN of the associated resource as the <code>SourceArn</code>. If you grant permission
            to a service principal without specifying the source, other accounts could potentially
            configure resources in their account to invoke your Lambda function.

            When you create a function, Lambda provisions an instance of the function and its
            supporting resources. If your function connects to a VPC, this process can take a
            minute or so. During this time, you can't invoke or modify the function. The <code>State</code>,
            <code>StateReason</code>, and <code>StateReasonCode</code> fields in the response
            from <a>GetFunctionConfiguration</a> indicate when the function is ready to invoke.

            <para>
            A function has an unpublished version, and can have published versions and aliases.
            The unpublished version changes when you update your function's code and configuration.
            A published version is a snapshot of your function code and configuration that can't
            be changed. An alias is a named resource that maps to a version, and can be changed
            to map to a different version. Use the <code>Publish</code> parameter to create version
            <code>1</code> of your function from its initial configuration.
            </para>
             
            <para>
            The other parameters let you configure version-specific and function-level settings.
            You can modify version-specific settings later with <a>UpdateFunctionConfiguration</a>.
            Function-level settings apply to both the unpublished and published versions of the
            function, and include tags (<a>TagResource</a>) and per-function concurrency limits
            (<a>PutFunctionConcurrency</a>).

            <para>
            You can use code signing if your deployment package is a .zip file archive. To enable
            code signing for this function, specify the ARN of a code-signing configuration. When
            a user attempts to deploy a code package with <a>UpdateFunctionCode</a>, Lambda checks
            that the code package has a valid signature from a trusted publisher. The code-signing
            configuration includes set of signing profiles, which define the trusted publishers
            for this function.

            If another Amazon Web Services account or an Amazon Web Service invokes your function,
            use <a>AddPermission</a> to grant permission by creating a resource-based Identity
            and Access Management (IAM) policy. You can grant permissions at the function level,
            on a version, or on an alias.

            <summary>
            Invokes a Lambda function. You can invoke a function synchronously (and wait for the
            response), or asynchronously. To invoke a function asynchronously, set <code>InvocationType</code>
            to <code>Event</code>.
            
             
            <para>
            For <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/invocation-sync.html">synchronous
            invocation</a>, details about the function response, including errors, are included
            in the response body and headers. For either invocation type, you can find more information
            in the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/monitoring-functions.html">execution
            log</a> and <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-x-ray.html">trace</a>.

            <para>
            When an error occurs, your function may be invoked multiple times. Retry behavior
            varies by error type, client, event source, and invocation type. For example, if you
            invoke a function asynchronously and it returns an error, Lambda executes the function
            up to two more times. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/invocation-retries.html">Error
            handling and automatic retries in Lambda</a>.
            </para>

            For <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/invocation-async.html">asynchronous
            invocation</a>, Lambda adds events to a queue before sending them to your function.
            If your function does not have enough capacity to keep up with the queue, events may
            be lost. Occasionally, your function may receive the same event multiple times, even
            if no error occurs. To retain events that were not processed, configure your function
            with a <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/invocation-async.html#invocation-dlq">dead-letter
            queue</a>.

            The status code in the API response doesn't reflect function errors. Error codes are
            reserved for errors that prevent your function from executing, such as permissions
            errors, <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/gettingstarted-limits.html">quota</a>
            errors, or issues with your function's code and configuration. For example, Lambda
            returns <code>TooManyRequestsException</code> if running the function would cause
            you to exceed a concurrency limit at either the account level (<code>ConcurrentInvocationLimitExceeded</code>)
            or function level (<code>ReservedFunctionConcurrentInvocationLimitExceeded</code>).

            For functions with a long timeout, your client might disconnect during synchronous

            settings.
